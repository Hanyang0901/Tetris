# Description
The player uses the keyboard to control the current drop graphic. The player can control the movement of the graphic (left or right). Then, players can control the speed of the drop. Next, the player also can rotate the graphic (90 degree rotation).
When the graphic falls to the bottom of the game space or touches other bottoming graphics, the dropping stops and the player cannot continue to manipulate the graphic.The line is automatically eliminated when the drop pattern controlled by the player fills all the spaces in the horizontal line.
In addition, the player gets points each time the player removes a line. In the end, when a graphic cannot fall, the game ends.
Whats more, we have reward system. if you get more points, you will have greater probablity to eliminate one line.
